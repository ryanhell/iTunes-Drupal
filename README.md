iTunes-Drupal
=============

The Who : <br>Client is an online collaberation and educational center, via Drupal 6. <br>

The What : <br>This client needs/wants to be able to offer podcast using Vimeo and Podcast on iTunes.<br>

Where<br>
on itunes, via Vimeo
inside Drupal 6 using Views, etc.


Where Else<br>
On a Drupal 6.x site. So inside a banner. Primary/main inside the left 2/3's of banner, 3 thumbnails along right 1/3's.
SEE WIREFRAMES. We should try to have video inside of video, I think this is possible using Views and choosing the thumbnail image type as video possibly, but I need to see.
<IMG SRC="http://nwtronix.com/images/wireframe1.png" ALT="Wireframe 1" WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=32>
<IMG SRC="http://nwtronix.com/images/wireframe2.png" ALT="Wireframe 2" WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=32>

Note<br>
we should not be using HTML and CSS soley as a way of creating a banner for static video thumbnails. Reason for this
is the client will obviously need to add or modify content themselves as new vids are created. Also, views does a nicer 
job with media types, and we may be able to achieve video inside of video using views and slideshow.
